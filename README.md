I'm Va'Najae, a web developer and college student based in the United States.

I design, code, and build whatever comes to my mind.

I am currently learning to become a full-stack developer and am familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at the moment.

Fun Facts:

- I like working out.
- I love app development.
- I love video games.
